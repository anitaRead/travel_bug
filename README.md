## TRAVEL BUG

For our final project, we decided to create a web application, Travel Bug, that will enable users to view travel restrictions to potential holiday destinations, so they are able to make informed choices regarding future trips.

It uses:
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/) web framework for Node.js.
- [Nodemon](https://nodemon.io/) to reload the server automatically.
- [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/) to render view templates.
- [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com) to model objects in MongoDB.
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org) for linting.
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for testing.
- [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) for end-to-end testing.
